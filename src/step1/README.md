# Step 1

## Changes
* Create functions for code 
* Turn values that are frequently changed into parameters of functions

## Advantages
* Easier to experiment with different values

## Disadvantages
* It is hard for new users to have a general understanding of the process
* Need to dig into the source code to change values of the parameters


## Things Need to be Improved
* Find a way to visualize the connections between functions
* Use configuration files to collect all parameters into one place

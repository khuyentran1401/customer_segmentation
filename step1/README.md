# Step 1

## Changes
* Create functions for code 
* Turn values that are frequently changed into parameters of functions
* Add tests

## Advantages
* Easier to experiment with different values
* Easier to test functions 
* Faster to make changes to the code

## Disadvantages
* It is hard for new users to have a general understanding of the process


## Things Need to be Improved
* Find a way to visualize the connections between functions
